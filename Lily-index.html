		<h3>Greetings! My name is Ching Yan Lee, feel free to call me Lily!</h3>
		<p>I graduated from CUSCS with a Higher Diploma in Digital Animation and Creative Media, but I have worked as a highschool teaching assistant for over two years. One day, I thought it was time for me to step out of my comfort zone. Therefore I quit my job and started developing my interests in design, front-end and UX/UI. In my leisure time, I enjoy making desserts - it is a great pleasure to see the satisfied smiling faces from my family and friends. It takes a lot of patience and focus to make those dessetys, but it helps me reduce my stress a lot. </p>
